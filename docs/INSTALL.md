# Install on another Windows device

The tested host is Hermes Desktop **0.21.5+3337**. Native installation uses Hermes' own runtime; scene extraction uses its bundled Node or Node.js 22+ on PATH. The current local-path and Wallpaper Engine discovery implementation targets Windows; macOS/Linux and mobile platforms are not supported by this distribution.

## Recommended: native plugin install

```sh
hermes plugins install CaptainMusX/hermes-skins/plugin --enable
```

Or open **Capabilities → Plugins → Install from Git**, enter `CaptainMusX/hermes-skins/plugin`, and install/enable both components. Everything is prebuilt: no manual clone, npm dependency installation, file copying, or custom installer is needed. Reopen Hermes after first installation and restart the gateway for scene routes. Update with `hermes plugins update hermes-skins`.

Private repositories require access credentials on the target device. An existing manually copied backend needs backup and a reinstall with `--force`. The plugin is not listed in the public discovery catalog. Catalog admission is a separate review; the embedded wallpaper player does not yet satisfy its desktop-script lint.

## Offline fallback: ZIP

This fallback requires Node.js 22+ to run its installer.

1. Extract the built ZIP and open its `hermes-skins-v1.3.4` folder.
2. Run `install.cmd`, or run `node scripts/install-local.js` from that folder. No npm dependency installation or build is needed.
3. Run **Reload desktop plugins** in Hermes. Restart the gateway after the first installation of the scene backend.
4. Open **Skin Center** and select your theme and wallpaper.

Set `HERMES_HOME` before installing if you use a custom data directory. The installer validates the payload first and backs up existing files beside them as `.bak-*`.

`--frontend-only` installs themes, glass styling, and basic wallpaper support without the scene backend. `--no-enable` deploys all files but leaves backend activation to the administrator; run `hermes plugins enable hermes-skins` and restart the gateway afterwards.

The archive contains no user settings, accounts, chats, Steam wallpapers, or scene caches. Choose the same built-in skin on the new device, or export the **current Theme Studio form** as JSON and import/save it on the target. This is not a full settings export: copy transparency/blur values manually, copy your own media separately, and update paths. Re-select Wallpaper Engine projects from the target device's own library.

True terminal transparency requires the included optional host-source patch and a compatible Hermes rebuild. The plugin installer does not patch the Hermes executable.

To build from the private source repository (access required):

```sh
npm ci
npm test
npm run package:desktop
```

Archives and SHA-256 files are written to `dist/`. A 404 scene API usually means the backend is not enabled or the gateway needs a restart. Unsupported scenes may fall back to embedded video or a static frame. To roll back, close Hermes, restore the corresponding `.bak-*` files, and reopen it.

The package retains the project MIT license and third-party license notices. The source revision and BSD license for dsh-skins are recorded in `third_party/dsh-skins/NOTICE.md`.
